#Eco-store
It is project to replicate in the course *"Fundamentos de SASS"* by **Platzi**. One of the main challenges I faced in the project was ~~making the landing page full responsive~~ so anyone can enjoy the website as much as took me to create it. Another thread I faced, was styling the product images, since I had not too wide experience it forced me to make some research and (obviously) asking chatGPT, so I could not only understand its behavior, but also **try and fail over and over** in order to get the result expected. 

I had fun creating the landing page, I learned how productive can be a preprocessor and most importantly, I did not gave up when I felt I would not be able to make it.

Hey give it a try in the following link (clearly the website is static, but keep it between you and me until I learn JS ðŸ¤«)!
